# JavaScript 30-Day Vanilla Practice 🚀

This repository contains my daily hands-on practice of core JavaScript — focusing only on Vanilla JS (no frameworks).

## ✅ Progress

| Day | Topics Covered |
|-----|----------------|
| Day 1 | Variables, Data Types, Operators |
| Day 2 | Conditions (`if`, `else`, `ternary`), Loops (`for`, `while`) |
| Day 3 | Functions (with return/params), First-Class Functions |
| Day 4 | Array Methods - `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `slice`, `splice` |

> 💡 All files organized in day-wise folders. Each day has pure practice, not tutorials.

## ✅ Day 4 – JavaScript Practice

### Topics Covered:
- Array Methods: `map()`, `filter()`

### Practice Files:
- `map-practice.js`: Basic to intermediate problems on `map()`
- `filter-practice.js`: Value filtering, object filtering, truthy value filtering

### Learning Notes:
- Practiced real-world use-cases of `map()` like price updates, greetings, etc.
- Filtered arrays by conditions: score, price, status, and removed falsy values.
- Understood the difference between transformation (`map`) and selection (`filter`).

### Status:
- [x] map() completed ✅
- [x] filter() completed ✅
- [ ] reduce() – scheduled for next session

## 📅 Plan


- Day 5: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Day 6–10: String methods, DOM manipulation
- Day 11–30: Projects, deep logic, async JS, and mini-apps
