# JavaScript 30-Day Vanilla Practice 🚀

This repository contains my daily hands-on practice of core JavaScript — focusing only on Vanilla JS (no frameworks).

## ✅ Progress

| Day | Topics Covered |
|-----|----------------|
| Day 1 | Variables, Data Types, Operators |
| Day 2 | Conditions (`if`, `else`, `ternary`), Loops (`for`, `while`) |
| Day 3 | Functions (with return/params), First-Class Functions |
| Day 4 | Array Methods - `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `slice`, `splice` |

> 💡 All files organized in day-wise folders. Each day has pure practice, not tutorials.

---

## 📅 Plan

- Day 5: `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`
- Day 6–10: String methods, DOM manipulation
- Day 11–30: Projects, deep logic, async JS, and mini-apps
